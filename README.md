# Fruit-Segmentation-with-Mask-RCNN


##Objective:
- The objective of this work is to detect individual fruits and obtain pixel-wise mask for each detected fruit in an image. To this end, we presents a deep learning approach, to detection and pixel-wise segmentation of fruits based on the state-of-the-art instance segmentation framework, Mask R-CNN.
- Identifying a fruit in an image and drawing a bounding box on it
